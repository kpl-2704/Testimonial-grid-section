# Testimonial-grid-section1.Title of Project:Testimonial Section

2.Project Description:

At Newton School,I was required to code this testimonial section as nearly same as the refernce provided.For this,I have used here CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox and other CSS properties.Coding this section was fun as well as challenging,It was easy to code for desktop screen,but for the mobile it was little bit complicated to code.I took more time to code it for the mobile screen by using Media queries.

3.How to Use the Project

You can use this pre-made template in a personal portfolio website in the testimonial or the review section.You can use this directly without the need to code it.

4.Credits

I am very thankful to Newton School that they gave this project to perform which was very helpful for me.
